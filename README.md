## Notes:

Yes, you can deploy this project to AWS and still use the OS package, as well as upload and use source videos. However, you'll need to make some adjustments to your setup and code. Here's how you can approach this:


## autoeditoer output
1. to manage autogenerate video audio srt output files path go to autoeditor/generator.py line 69 74.
2. to improve, make the audio piece not generated at outputs folder
3. strange temp out reel_output_p1TEMP_MPY_wvf_snd generated in root folder and is auto deleted

## script generated
control the json file input in workflow.py
