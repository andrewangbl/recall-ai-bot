But they also play detective, monitoring betting patterns to flag unusual activity. Tom Harding, a match-fixing investigator, highlights the vulnerability of individual sports like tennis to match-fixing scandals. Remember when Novak Djokovic was offered $200k to lose a match? He flatly refused, but others, lured by the promise of easy money, may not. As sports betting evolves, protecting the integrity of the game while leveraging it for revenue and fan engagement remains a top priority."
