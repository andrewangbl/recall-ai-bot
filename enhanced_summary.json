    "Let's delve into the hidden costs of construction, as discussed in the video 'The hidden cost of construction | Micheal Green | TEDxVictoria', summarized by Recall.",
    "Did you know construction noise is a global issue? It impacts healthcare systems and life expectancy due to ailments like dementia. It's a cost that's often overlooked.",
    "Unfortunately, the construction industry is not incentivized to innovate and tackle its negative impacts, such as noise and carbon emissions. These costs are shouldered by society.",
    "The concept of 'true cost' broadens the way we think about construction costs. It's not just about labor and materials, it includes planetary costs like pollution and societal costs like noise pollution.",
    "There is a pressing need for a shift in focus. We should consider the comprehensive 'true cost' for more sustainable and responsible construction practices.",
    "Sustainability can be achieved in construction. For instance, building with wood reduces carbon footprints. Minimizing disruptions like road closures can reduce emissions and benefit local businesses.",
    "An example of change is the Black and White Building in London. It maintained a noise level below 36 dB during construction, showing that consideration for surroundings is possible.",
    "Innovation in construction is in dire need of investment. Despite challenges, the industry has become less efficient with more documentation and processes than before.",
    "AI could be the game-changer. By analyzing siloed data, it can reveal the true cost of construction projects, including impacts on health, education, and the environment. This transparency can spark innovation.",
    "Governments often aim for the lowest possible cost in constructing affordable housing. But this approach overlooks long-term costs like building durability and resident well-being.",
    "The construction industry significantly impacts the global economy, with spending projected to reach $24 trillion by 2032. Implementing biophilia, or bringing nature into our spaces, can reduce stress and increase productivity, saving significant costs over time."
