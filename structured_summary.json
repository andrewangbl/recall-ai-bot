    "The True Cost of Construction": [
      "Construction noise is a serious global issue with a measurable human cost, impacting health care systems and life expectancy due to stress-related ailments like dementia.",
      "The construction industry is not incentivized to innovate and address its negative cost implications, such as noise and carbon emissions, which are borne by society.",
      "The current method of calculating building costs, which includes hard costs (labor and materials) and soft costs (design fees, permits, taxes, etc.), fails to account for the complete impact of construction on the environment and society.",
      "A concept called \"true cost\" is introduced, which encompasses not only project costs but also planetary costs (e.g., pollution, deforestation), societal costs (e.g., noise pollution), performance costs, and process costs.",
      "A shift from focusing solely on project costs to considering the comprehensive \"true cost,\" incorporating data from various fields like climate science and sociology, is crucial for promoting sustainable and responsible construction practices."
    ],
    "Sustainable Construction Practices": [
      "Building with wood, particularly in large-scale projects, offers a more sustainable alternative to concrete and steel, significantly reducing carbon dioxide footprints.",
      "Choosing construction methods that minimize disruptions, such as road closures, can positively impact local businesses, reduce traffic congestion, and lower emissions.",
      "The Black and White Building in London, constructed entirely from timber, maintained a noise level below 36 dB during its construction to accommodate a neighboring recording studio, demonstrating that change and consideration for surrounding environments are achievable in construction practices."
    ],
    "The Need for Innovation in Construction": [
      "There is a significant lack of investment in innovation within the construction industry, despite the vast potential for addressing major challenges.",
      "The construction industry has become less efficient, with projects now requiring significantly more documentation and processes compared to the past. For example, Frank Lloyd Wright only needed 13 sheets of paper to design and build Falling Water, while a similar project today would require hundreds of sheets and extensive documentation.",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to analyze the vast amounts of data currently siloed in different departments and ministries to determine the true cost of construction projects, including their impact on health, education, and the environment. This transparency can incentivize innovation and lead to more sustainable and cost-effective building practices."
    ],
    "The Long-Term Costs of Affordable Housing": [
      "Governments often aim to construct affordable housing at the lowest possible cost, prioritizing low-cost design teams and materials to minimize taxpayer expenses.",
      "However, this approach overlooks the long-term costs associated with factors like building durability and the well-being of residents."
    ],
    "The Economic Impact of Construction": [
      "The global construction industry represents a significant portion of the global economy, with an estimated spending of \\$13.5 trillion in 2023, projected to reach \\$24 trillion by 2032.",
      "Biophilia, the concept of bringing nature into living and working environments, can reduce stress and increase productivity. By reducing sick days by 5% to 10% in a company with 1,000 highly paid employees, the cost savings over 10 years become significant."
